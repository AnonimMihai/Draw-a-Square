# Draw-a-Square
This is a simple Python program that asks for one of the sides of a square and then draws the square on the screen and also finds its perimeter.

To run it you need to: First Method (easy): Have Python installed and run the "main.py" script Second Method (medium): Have Python and Pyinstaller installed, run the command "pyinstaller --onefile /path/to/main.py" where "/path/to/main.py" is the location of the "main.py" script. If you use Windows you will need to do "pyinstaller --onefile \path\to\main.py"
